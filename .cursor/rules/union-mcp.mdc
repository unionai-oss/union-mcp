# Prerequisites

If it's unclear what project and domain to use, ask the user for the project and domain that they are trying to access.

# Running local workflows

When asked to run a task or workflow locally, use the following CLI command template in a terminal:

```bash
union run --remote --project <project> --domain <domain> <file.py> <task_or_workflow_name> <input_flags>
```

If the user has a `.venv` directory in their project repo, make sure to activate the virtual environment before running the `union run` command.

# Getting execution errors

To get errors from a remote execution, use the Union MCP `get_execution` tool. This
will return an execution JSON object containing the error text.

# Getting remote information

In general, when the user asks for information about a remote task, workflow, or execution, use the Union MCP `list_tasks`, `list_workflows`, `get_tasks`, `get_workflows`, or `get_execution` tools.

To run remote tasks and workflows, use the Union MCP `run_task` and `run_workflow` tools.
